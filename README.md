# Coronavirus-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis - Classification Machine Learning.

About the data :

Twitter is one of the most powerful social media platform in the world right now , with 360 million monthly active users and around 500 million tweets sent each day. It is used every day by people to express opinions about different topics, such as products, movies, music, politicians, events, social events, among others. We all were going through the unprecedented time of the Corona Virus pandemic. Some people lost their lives, but many of us successfully defeated this new strain i.e. Covid-19. The virus was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization on 11th March 2020. This project will analyze various types of “Tweets” gathered during pandemic times. The study can be helpful for different stakeholders. In this project, we are going to predict the Sentiments of COVID-19 tweets. The data gathered from the Tweeter and I’m going to use Python environment to implement this project. The original dataset has 6 columns and 41157 rows. In order to analyze various sentiments, We require just two columns named Original Tweet and Sentiment. There are five types of sentiments- Extremely Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, and Extremely Positive as you can see in the following

Problem Statement :

COVID 19 is a global pandemic that is still infecting millions of people around the world. For the project we are provided with a corona virus Tweets CSV file which contains more than 40000 tweets from people around the world on COVID 19 and our aims to analyze these tweets made on COVID 19 from around the world and predict the sentiment of each of the tweet by classifying them into three categories positive, negative & neutral
What is mean by Sentiment Analysis ?
Sentiment Analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer’s attitude towards a particular topic is Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

CONCLUSION ON MODEL TRAINING :

Thus we conclude our project on coronavirus Tweet Sentiment Analysis. We started by analyzing the dataset to learn more about the variables involved. As a part of Exploratory Data Analysis, we tried to derive different patterns in the data. For building different classification models we used the future 'OriginalTweet' and the target variable 'Sentiment'. By performing tweet cleaning, Removing stopwords, Removing punctuations and Stemming, We prepared the column 'OriginalTweet' for modeling.

We applied 5 different classification models among which Logistic Regression is the best performing model. Logistic Regression with 80% (approx) accuracy performed well for multinomial classification.
